# CSE-590 - RISC Architecture 
Reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architectures is the basis of modern high-performance processors. They have a simplified instruction set, with register-to-register arithmetic instructions. Memory can only be accessed by load and store instructions, usually with a single, simple addressing mode. These instructions have a fixed size and few simple formats. RISC processors use pipelining and their instruction set allows tight control of their pipeline by the software. Optimizing compilers perform instruction scheduling so as to exploit the parallelism offered by the pipelined data path. RISC processors achieve high performance at low cost, smaller and simpler circuits allow higher clock rates. The data path can use pipelining, which can be exploited by the compiler.
